# 🏍️ Realistic Motocross Bike Template

## ✅ **What's New**

I've completely redesigned the bike spawning system to create realistic-looking motocross bikes instead of basic blocks.

## 🏍️ **Bike Components**

### **Frame & Structure**
- **Main Frame**: Black metal chassis (6x0.5x1.5 studs)
- **Engine Block**: Dark grey metal engine (1.5x1.5x1 studs)
- **Gas Tank**: Red/Yellow plastic tank (2x1x1.2 studs)
- **Exhaust Pipe**: Metal exhaust system with realistic positioning

### **Rider Area**
- **Vehicle Seat**: Compact rider seat (2x0.3x1.2 studs)
- **Handlebars**: Black metal handlebars (0.2x0.2x3 studs)
- **Positioning**: Proper motocross riding position

### **Suspension System**
- **Front Fork**: Metal suspension fork for front wheel
- **Rear Shock**: Yellow neon shock absorber for rear suspension
- **Realistic Positioning**: Proper motocross bike geometry

### **Wheels**
- **Front Wheel**: Smaller steering wheel (2.2 stud diameter)
- **Rear Wheel**: Larger power wheel (2.8 stud diameter)
- **Rim Details**: Aluminum rims with spoke effects
- **Tire Material**: Rubber material for realistic appearance

## 🎨 **Color Schemes**

### **Main Server Bikes (Red)**
- Seat: Bright Red
- Gas Tank: Bright Red
- Frame: Black
- Engine: Dark Grey
- Wheels: Black with Aluminum rims

### **Backup Server Bikes (Yellow)**
- Seat: Bright Yellow
- Gas Tank: Bright Yellow
- Frame: Black
- Engine: Dark Grey
- Wheels: Black with Aluminum rims

## ⚙️ **Physics Settings**

- **Max Speed**: 100 (realistic motocross speed)
- **Torque**: 15,000 (powerful acceleration)
- **Turn Speed**: 35 (responsive steering)
- **Wheel Physics**: Proper collision detection
- **Frame-based**: Uses frame as primary part for better stability

## 🎮 **How to Use**

1. **Spawn**: Press R to spawn your motocross bike
2. **Auto-sit**: You'll automatically be seated on the bike
3. **Controls**: Use WASD to ride
   - W = Throttle forward
   - S = Brake/reverse
   - A/D = Steer left/right

## 🔧 **Technical Improvements**

- **Better Proportions**: Realistic motocross bike dimensions
- **Detailed Parts**: Multiple components welded together
- **Improved Physics**: Frame-based primary part for stability
- **Visual Appeal**: Looks like an actual motocross bike
- **Consistent Template**: Both main and backup systems use same design

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

The bike now looks much more realistic! You can further customize by:
- Adding decals/textures for sponsors
- Creating different bike models/colors
- Adding particle effects for dirt/dust
- Implementing bike damage/wear systems
- Adding bike upgrade mechanics

Enjoy your new realistic motocross bikes! 🏁
