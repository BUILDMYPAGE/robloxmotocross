🚨 EMERGENCY BIKE FIX - STEP BY STEP CHECKLIST
===============================================

The problem: You have old scripts still running that are blocking the CleanPrototype!

🔧 IMMEDIATE FIX (Do this now):

□ 1. STOP the current game in Roblox Studio

□ 2. Add FORCE_CLEAN_SETUP.server.lua to ServerScriptService
   - This will disable all conflicting scripts

□ 3. Make sure you have these TWO files in the right places:
   ✅ CleanPrototype.server.lua → ServerScriptService
   ✅ CleanPrototype.client.lua → StarterPlayerScripts
   
   IMPORTANT: Name them exactly "CleanPrototype" (remove .server.lua and .client.lua extensions)

□ 4. RUN the game again

□ 5. Look for this message in Output:
   "🏁 CLEAN MOTOCROSS PROTOTYPE STARTING..."
   
   If you DON'T see this message, the CleanPrototype isn't running!

□ 6. Once you see the startup message, press R to spawn bike

□ 7. Use WASD to drive

🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING:

❌ If you see "TestServer" or "Main" messages:
   → Old scripts are still running - use FORCE_CLEAN_SETUP again

❌ If bike doesn't spawn:
   → Check that you see "🏍️ Spawn request from [YourName]" in Output

❌ If no startup message appears:
   → CleanPrototype.server.lua is not in ServerScriptService or is disabled

✅ SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE:
   - Only sees "🏁 CLEAN MOTOCROSS PROTOTYPE STARTING..."
   - No "TestServer" or "Main" messages
   - Bike spawns when pressing R
   - WASD controls work

The key is making sure ONLY the CleanPrototype scripts run!
