# 🏍️ Motocross Bike Straddling Fix

## ✅ **What's Fixed**

I've updated the motocross bike design to ensure the rider properly straddles the bike like a real motocross rider.

## 🏍️ **Key Improvements for Rider Position**

### **VehicleSeat Adjustments**
- **Size**: Increased to 2×0.8×1.8 studs (wider for straddling)
- **Height**: Raised to 1.2 studs above spawn position
- **Angle**: Tilted slightly forward (-5 degrees) for authentic motocross position
- **Position**: Moved to center of bike frame for proper balance

### **Handlebars Position**
- **Height**: Raised to 2.2 studs to match rider reach
- **Position**: Properly positioned for natural grip while straddling

### **Added Foot Pegs**
- **Left Foot Peg**: Positioned at left side of bike (-1.2 Z offset)
- **Right Foot Peg**: Positioned at right side of bike (+1.2 Z offset)
- **Height**: Low position (0.2 studs) for natural foot placement
- **Material**: Dark grey metal for authentic look

### **Enhanced Seating System**
- **Double Check**: Retry seating if first attempt fails
- **Proper Validation**: Ensures `Humanoid.Sit` is true
- **Better Positioning**: Seat is disabled then re-enabled for clean seating

## 🎮 **Expected Result**

Now when you spawn a bike and sit on it, the rider should:
- ✅ **Straddle the bike** with legs on either side
- ✅ **Reach the handlebars** naturally
- ✅ **Have feet positioned** on the foot pegs
- ✅ **Lean slightly forward** in authentic motocross position

## 🔧 **Technical Changes**

### **Both Bike Systems Updated**
- 🔴 **Main Server Bikes** (Red) - Updated with straddling position
- 🟡 **Backup Server Bikes** (Yellow) - Updated with same improvements

### **Improved Auto-Seating**
```lua
-- Better seating mechanism
seat.Disabled = false
seat:Sit(player.Character.Humanoid)

-- Retry if needed
wait(0.5)
if not player.Character.Humanoid.Sit then
    seat:Sit(player.Character.Humanoid)
end
```

## 🏁 **Test Instructions**

1. **Spawn a bike**: Press R
2. **Check rider position**: Should be straddling with legs apart
3. **Verify handlebars**: Arms should reach naturally
4. **Check foot placement**: Feet should be positioned correctly

The rider should now look like they're properly riding a motocross bike instead of just sitting on a chair! 🏍️
